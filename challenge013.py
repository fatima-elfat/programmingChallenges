"""
challenge013: Tic Tac Toe blocker.
In this Python challenge,
write a function thatâ€™ll accept two numbers.
These numbers will represent a position on a tic-tac-toe board.
They can be 0 through 8, where 0 is the top-left spot,
and 8 is the bottom-right spot.

These parameters are two marks on the tic-tac-toe board.
The function should return the number of the spot
that can block these two spots from winning the game.
